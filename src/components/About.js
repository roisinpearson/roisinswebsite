                <h2> ABOUT ME </h2>
                <h3> Hi I'm Roisin </h3>
                <p> I am a Victoria University of Wellington design student who has recently returned from studying
                    abroad at Carnegie Mellon University in the U.S.
                    I was born and raised in Napier, and now live in Wellington, NZ! </p>
                <p>
                    Technology focused design is what I am most passionate about, espescially web design and
                    development.
                    I am interested in where code meets design and feel that knowledge of these two practises is
                    becoming
                    more useful in our technologically advancing world.
                </p>

                <p> Aside from designing things for the web, I also enjoy making physical interactive technologies.
                    Creating devices with Arduino or the Particle Photon allows me to continuously come up with new
                    ideas
                    and brainstorm future possibilites for our world. </p>

                <p> I'm currently looking for a full time job for 2019! </p>
